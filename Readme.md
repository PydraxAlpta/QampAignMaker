# QampAign Maker

This is a project for merging together json exports of discord pseudo D&D style campaigns. It's named after Q&A, the first popular one within our community of servers.

Run this project as a local server using any standard tool like live server or http-server or python http.server. Select JSON files to read from and then select sections from the pages to stage into the final chapter file. You can remove them from the final file again, but you will have to make your selection from the source file again.

The output json saved will be later used with a second project, the QampAign Reader in order to view the json files together with assets. When released, it will be linked here.
